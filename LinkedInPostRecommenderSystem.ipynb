I want to share an experience that happened yesterday highlighting this....💻 My friend reached out to learn about the data space as he is preparing for a big interview. I spent 30 minutes explaining what\\'s considered \"the modern data stack\", but the most important conversation happened at the end.🧐 I asked, \"Do you have any constructive feedback for me? I want to do more public speaking on the topic of data, and I would love to know what worked and didn\\'t for our conversation.\"🎤 He informed me that the way I emphasize certain words when I speak was extremely helpful in learning a new topic.🤯 MY MIND WAS BLOWN, as it informed me of a strength that 1) I was completely unaware of, and 2) I can further refine.📈 Asking for feedback may make you feel vulnerable at first, but in the long run it will provide you key insights for long term success. Some feedback is amazing (both positive and constructive), and other feedback can be lacking. Regardless, someone going out if their comfort zone to give feedback is a major gift.#OnTheMarkData #feedback #learning #success #growth #data #dataanalytics #datascience #dataengineering #datascientists #dataanalyst #dataengineer #mlengineer #ml #ai #machinelearning',\n",

Below is a screenshot of the project summary, and check this post's comments for a sneak peek of some of the code.My learning objectives for those who follow this tutorial are the following:1. Creating an analysis plan for a data science project.2. Using Naas drivers to pull your LinkedIn post data.3. Feature engineering to create meaningful variables.4. Preparing text data for an NLP analysis.5. Conducting a bag-of-words NLP analysis.This will all be on a public GitHub repo, including my own LinkedIn post data if you don't have enough of your own content to analyze! I really hope this will help folks learn about how fun NLP is, as well as help create an awesome project for their portfolios.#OnTheMarkData\\xa0#datascience\\xa0#data\\xa0#dataanalytics\\xa0#machinelearning\\xa0#python\\xa0#nlp\\xa0#analytics\\xa0#ai\\xa0#github\\xa0#linkedin\\xa0#datascientists\\xa0#dataanalyst\\xa0#naturallanguageprocessing\\xa0#ml\\xa0#naas\"]"

I bet many can relate given the pandemic.My old self would just try to \"out work\" the situation and try to take on everything...... and eventually burn out hard.This time I took a step back and asked myself \"what do I value, and what can I realistically handle to ensure I maintain what I value?\"The hardest part was the \"realistic\" component, as I\\'m passionate about so many things and give my all to them. But eventually I prioritized and cut out a lot from my life.The result... handling life\\'s challenges became easier and quicker to resolve. I\\'m able to focus more on what I care about and I\\'m a lot better at saying \"no\" or \"not right now.\"Though there are a few things I really want to bring back into my life (e.g. community health volunteering), I feel much more capable now of being able to tell when I can realistically do so.#DataHustle #priorities #values #life #pandemiclife  #accomplishments #goal #achievement #boundaries #selfcare',\n",

              " '🙌🏽 It\\'s #WednesdayWork, a post series to give a glimpse of working as a data scientist, and today we are talking about BIG IDEAS with my manager Stefanie Tignor!💡 Once a month, my manager holds a \"BIG IDEAS MEETING\" to discuss the big picture of the data team\\'s work. In our last meeting, I asked how she has been able to get buy-in on so many ideas that ultimately turn into features within our product.👇🏽 Below are the two skills she said are key to her success:🎯 1. She is constantly talking to colleagues outside of her team (e.g. Sales, UX, Design, etc.) to learn about their pain points and hear moments where they say \"I wish I had XYZ...\" More importantly, she informed us that many of the ideas are not hers, but rather she curates conversations to find patterns and suggestions to act on.🎬 2. She has a bias towards action! Many individuals have ideas, but very few actually act on the ideas to get momentum behind them. Specifically, when she identifies an idea she aims to build a proof of concept in ~2 weeks and then get feedback. This is the key action she takes to go from idea to a whole team building a new product feature!#OnTheMarkData #WednesdayWisdom #product #ml #startups #dataanalysis, #datascientists #dataengineering #data #ai #datascience #dataanalytics',\n",

              " 'Having your goals attached to proving someone wrong is ultimately a losing game.It was 2013, and I failed most of my classes the semester before I was supposed to transfer. Thus, I decided to call the university to see my options.This phone call resulted in me being berated for fifteen minutes straight by two admissions officers. They questioned my intelligence, work ethic, and capabilities as a person. The words that cut the deepest though were \"We don\\'t think you are fit to be a doctor.\"From that point on I decided that I was going to become a doctor to prove them wrong. Unfortunately, this set me on a path filled with unneeded stress and heartache.Most of my academic career was centered around proving two people wrong, rather than pursuing my passions. Every pursuit wasn\\'t good enough and every failure was blown out of proportion.It wasn\\'t until I was a student at Stanford Med where I realized I lost my passion of becoming a doctor years ago-- I was just trying to prove them wrong. All the pain I put myself through was unnecessary and it distracted me from identifying my true purpose.Now, I never let others define my capabilities or aptitude for success. My goals and happiness are my own!#OnTheMarkData #MotivationMonday #data #datascience #dataanalytics #career',\n",
              " 'I came very close to dropping out of Stanford in 2018. That year I had a mental breakdown, and was ultimately diagnosed with having OCD. For me, my symptoms typically look like mentally checking EVERYTHING or going on 48 hour work binges to get things \"perfect\". The habits I thought got me into Stanford, were actually the ones destroying my life.This event was a blessing in disguise, as it finally put me on a path to address the habits that brought me so much suffering. Today, I\\'m in a much better place due to all the work I put into therapy, my amazing wife, and my supportive family and friends.Even with the past few weeks being rough for me, my worst days today are 100x better than my best days in 2018. Here are three lessons that helped get me there:1) Know what your 100% capacity is (e.g. sum of work, hanging out, etc.) and bring yourself down to 75%. This gives me a buffer when things are rough to prevent burnout.2) Embrace discomfort and face your fears! Mental health challenges often makes discomfort extreme, but getting comfortable with being uncomfortable has helped silence the OCD voice.3) Treat self compassion as a lifestyle. Actively reframing thoughts within a self compassion lense dramatically reduced the burden of mental health.#DataHustle #MentalHealth',\n",

In her words:\"My family has kept me grounded. This year has been crazy for me, from just last week losing my biological mother, and I\\'m still here... still choosing to pursue my dreams, still coming out here, still making sure to make the family I do still have on this earth proud.And the fact that nobody knows what I go through. Everybody has struggles and I understand that, but y\\'all see me on this track and y\\'all see the poker face I put on, but nobody but them and my coach know what I go through on a day-to-day basis, and I\\'m highly grateful for them.Without them, there would be no me. Without my grandmother, there would be no Sha\\'Carri Richardson. So my family is my everything, my everything until the day I\\'m done.\"Though I\\'m nowhere close to being an Olympian, her words resonated deeply with me.

              " \"🏃🏽 The road to becoming and data professional, and more importantly staying one, is a marathon, not a sprint. Here are 3 tips to stay the course:📈 1. Stop chasing titles, and instead focus on identifying how you can drive value with data. Your ability to drive value will later provide you leverage to get the title and terms you desire.💻 2. Don't focus solely on the end goal, rather focus on the habits that will help you reach your goal. Three years ago I wanted to be a data scientist, instead of focusing on that goal I instead pursued the habit of coding at least 10 hours a week on data-related projects.😴 3. Learn how to relax and identify when you need a break. This is honestly the most important, and the one I struggle with the most. It's really hard to enjoy a career if you become burned out.👇🏽 What have you done that's been helpful?

              " \"🤳🏽Just wanted to share my current social media strategy to just exchange ideas with my network!🛠 My three main tools are Buffer, Canva, and Google Sheets.📝 Weekends I create all of my Monday through Friday content following my daily hashtag themes (e.g. MondayMotivation and WednesdayWork). I make sure to try to add a screenshot, video, or create a quote image via Canva (i.e. drag and drop illustrator) for every post.⏰ I then put my weekly content in Buffer to schedule my posts for the week and have them automatically send.👉🏽 Currently I send at 9AM PST. The goal is to reach the west coast right before work and the east coast during lunch break. I then spend 15min on my lunch break to respond to any comments to drive further engagement. I then spend another 15min after I get off work to engage with my network that's active after hours or respond to messages.🎙 On Friday evenings I comment a whole bunch on others' posts to engage new audiences and have full conversations in my messages. This is extremely useful as it inspires a lot of my own content.📋 Finally, after a post becomes inactive (~1 week) I collect relevant data (e.g. likes, views, comment count) per post in a Google Sheet for analysis later.🤓 Why go through all this effort? The work I do on LinkedIn is returned 10x from all the amazing conversations I have with others. It exposes me to different points of view and best practices that I bring into my current job. Also, I absolutely love talking about data so it's always a good time for me!#OnTheMarkData #datascience #data #datascientists #dataanalyst #dataanalytics #socialmedia #strategy #linkedin #content\"]"
